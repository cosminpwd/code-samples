# C++ desktop application for Windows, Linux and macOS
This is the theme code from the main window of a cross-platform C++ app. It has a theme editor and save and load from file.

## Details
- Variables that start with `m` are class member variables.
- Variables that start with `k` are class member static constants.
- Theme editor is on a separate thread so rendering is smooth (thread proc code not included in this sample).
