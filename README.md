# Code samples
Samples of code that I have written over the years. All of them have been extracted from much larger codebases and represent how I normally wrote production code at the time.

My preferred coding standard changed and evolved over the years, so the look and feel varies from sample to sample. Feel free to ask more details about any of these samples or any project from my portfolio.
